        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am an upcoming senior at <a href="https://www.aquinas-sta.org/">Saint Thomas Aquinas High School</a>.
          I am a 17 year old Haitian American who was born in Haiti but raised in Florida for most of my life.
          I am a Veritas Scholar, <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/high-school-students/college-prep-scholars">Questbridge College Prep Scholar</a>,
          and an <a href="https://olinwustl.campusgroups.com/bsba/olin-fleischer-scholars/#:~:text=The%20Olin%20Fleischer%20Scholars%20Program%20%28OFSP%29%20provides%20a,sophomores%2C%20juniors%2C%20and%20seniors%20in%20the%20Midwest%20region.">OFSP
            Scholar</a>.
          I am an aspiring teenage entrepreneur, programmer, and model. As a student, I am
          entirely dedicated to my academics. I have a 5.2 weighted GPA and a 3.8 unweighted GPA. I am a leader
          in my community and have completed more than 320 service
          hours during my three years at STA. One day, in the near future, I hope to major in either Finance or
          Aersopace Engineering and minor in either Business or Computer Science.
          Among learning programming codes such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I also have a passion for Investing
          and the Stock Market. I have a dream of becoming a millionaire by the age of
          25 and I intend to fulfill that promise. I am always looking to form new connections and gain positive
          experiences that will last a lifetime. Feel free to contact me at any of the socials listed below!</p>
